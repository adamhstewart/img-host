Mission Description: The party is approached by Lord Elric Halden, an aging noble and head of a once-prominent Barovian family. He lives alone on the edge of town in a crumbling estate with a large family graveyard. Elric is troubled - he claims he’s seen figures (teenagers? cultists?) sneaking into the crypt at night and swears he’s heard clawing noises from beneath the tomb.

He suspects grave robbers or perhaps occult activity but lacks proof—and no one will go near the place. He offers coin a if the party will investigate and "ensure nothing unholy remains."

DMing Style:  Mostly Rules as Written, but there are times where Cool must prevail. I like character-inclusive, plot-driven role play - but this one in particular will be "combat forward."

Additional Notes: One combat, which will be deadly - usual "character death is possible" warnings apply.
